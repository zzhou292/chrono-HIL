# Latency Compensation Sweep

Noise policy: sensor noise enabled in every run.
`--teleop-delay` applies fixed command-path delay in the simulator and passes the same delay estimate to safety filters for horizon/buffer inflation.
`--latency-profile-json` applies channel-specific time-varying control/manual/camera latency when provided.
This is an autonomous proxy for latency robustness; true driver behavior still belongs in `human_delay_compensation_rounds.py`.
