# Chrono::HIL: High-Performance Traffic Simulation Middleware with Human-in-the-Loop Support

## Overview

Chrono::HIL, an open-source middleware, is built upon the Chrono simulation framework, offering robust capabilities for large-scale and high-performance traffic simulations, integrated with human-in-the-loop driving simulation functionalities. This project is the brainchild of Json Zh Zhou, a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who continues to author and maintain the framework.

## Objectives

The primary goal of Chrono::HIL is to deliver an accessible, open-source solution for implementing driving simulators. It emphasizes large-scale and high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulations, coupled with interfaces for precise vehicle control. Key features of this middleware include:

- Multi-Fidelity Vehicle Dynamics Modeling: Enables collision handling with various terrains.
- High-Performance Computing: Supports parallel computing for handling large-scale traffic scenarios.
- Global Real-Time Simulation Enforcement: Guarantees the timely execution of simulations.
- Customizable Rendering and Control: Allows seamless integration with various driving simulators and computing clusters.
