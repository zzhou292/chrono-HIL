# chrono-HIL

Chrono::HIL is an open-source, chrono-based, large-scale, and high-performance traffic simulation middleware with human-in-the-loop driving simulation support. This middleware framework is authored and continuously maintained by Jason Zh Zhou (zzhou292@wisc.edu), currently a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The software framework aims to provide an open-source solution to driving simulator implementation with large-sacle and high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulation and interfaces to precise vehicle control. The features of the middleware structure are as follows:

* Multi-Fidelity Vehicle Dynamics Modelling with collision with the terrain.
* High-Performance Vehicle Dynamics parrallel computing functionalities to support large-scale traffic.
* Global real-time enforcement of the simulation.
* Highly customizable rendering and control coupling to allow installation on any driving simulators and computing clusters.

Chrono::HIL is released as an open-source software under BSD-3 license, in-line with the licensing used for Project Chrono (https://projectchrono.org/). While the middleware is free, open-souce, and anyone is free to modify and repackage the middleware for commercial purposes, there is no technical support comes with chrono::HIL. You are free to open an Issue, and Jason will try his best to porvide support. However no reponse or support is garanteed.

Software and Hardware support can be provided in the following cases, request priority ranking from high to low, please contact Jason (zzhou292@wisc.edu).
